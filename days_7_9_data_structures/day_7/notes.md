## Lists
* Python's version of an array
* List methods
    * There are several methods available to lists, including reverse, and sort
* Lists can also be created by using the list constructor
    * list(sequence)

## Immutability and Tuples
* Immutable - unable to be mutated (changed)
* Mutable - able to be mutated (changed)
* Lists and Dictionaries are mutable
* Tuples, however, are immutable
* Lists are denoted by [], while tuples are denoted by ()

## Creating and Parsing Dictionaries
* Dictionaries are denoted by {}
* Contain key value pairs
* Keys can be accessed with dict.keys() method
* Values can be accessed with dict.values() method
* Can access key value pairs with dict.items() method
* Access individual elements by indexing by the key
    * ie dict[key]
